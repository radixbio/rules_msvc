# MSVC in a windows box, snapshotted and transferred into WINE

Loosley, this boots a vagrant windows vm, snapshots the disk, installs visual studio, snapshots the disk
and loads the diff into a wine docker container. There's a `pkg.bzl` file that packs `cl.exe` and `link.exe` from
this container to a `msvc_jni` rule to build windows DLL's on linux.


This takes a ton of space, and does some fairly cursed things to make bazel and wine and docker and msvc to play nice
it currently only support MSVC 15 (2017)

also there's no way to get the snapshot out of vagrant using the qemu/libvirt stack, so i have these gems to do the snapshot file transfer
```
vagrant-libvirt (0.7.0, global)
vagrant-reload (0.0.1, global)
vagrant-scp (0.5.9, global)
vagrant-sshfs (1.3.6, global)
vagrant-winrm-syncedfolders (1.0.1, global)
virtualbox (0.8.6, global)
winrm (2.3.6, global)
winrm-elevated (1.2.3, global)
```


```
vagrant up --provider=libvirt --provision win-msvc15
scp vagrant@<<IP>>:C:\\vagrant\\msvc15 build
docker build -f Dockerfile -t my-msvc:15 --build-arg WINE_VER=6.12 --build-arg MSVC=15 .
docker build -f Dockerfile.winjdk -t msvc-winjdk:latest .
```
